# Life Expectancy Prediction Project


## Overview

This project focuses on predicting life expectancy using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis includes various features such as GDP, schooling, HIV/AIDS rate, etc. The goal is to explore the data, train a Linear Regression model, apply the powerful XGBoost algorithm, and compare their performance.
